# Mǽrstánas (Web App)

## Overview

**[Mǽrstánas](https://jaerrib.codeberg.page/maerstanas/)** is a free libre open
source abstract strategy game. Gameplay involves players alternately placing
stones within the squares of a 7x7 grid with the goal of creating connection
points between their own pieces. Scoring is based on the number of these
connections.

Development of the board game happens
on [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/jaerrib/maerstanas) and is mirrored
on [GitHub](https://github.com/jaerrib/maerstanas).

> Mǽrstánas means *boundary stones* in Anglo-Saxon (Old English).
