        <p class="fs-5">What does this app do?</p>
        <p>
            This web application (written using Python/Django) allows players to
            enjoy asynchronous games of Mǽrstánas with people around the world.
            Think of it like a platform that facilitates PBEM (play-by-email)
            games. You can create public games, password-protected private
            games, and invite players to a session. The app keeps track of your
            win-loss record and incorporates an Elo rating system similar to the
            one used for chess.

        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://maerstanas-python.fly.dev/">Python/Flask-based
                version</a> using the current rule set with either a local
                player or a computer opponent that uses simulation to "decide"
                what moves to play.
            </li>
            <li><a href="https://jaerrib.codeberg.page/maerstanas_js/">JavaScript-based
                version</a> that uses a simpler rule set and a very basic
                opponent that plays randomly without any consideration for
                strategy <em>(good for beginners!)</em>
